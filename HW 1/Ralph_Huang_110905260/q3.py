#Your model should work well in theory, but it has a problem:
#Too many people know what you know, and you canâ€™t profit using
#this strategy. You need to step up your game. What if you were
#able throw in more data to your model?
#Question. Write a program to parse and get all the
#Symbol, Last Price, Market Time, and Change fields
#from the "commodities futures" table from
#https://finance.yahoo.com/commodities. The program returns
#the a list of lists, where each list contains the
#Symbol, Name, Last Price and Market Time of a commodity.
#Write all these to a file named commodities.txt,
#one line for each commodity, and with comma separated values
#(e.g.,symbol, last price, market time, change )[15 pts].
#Hint: You do not have to use BeautifulSoup for this, but it
#may make things much easier
